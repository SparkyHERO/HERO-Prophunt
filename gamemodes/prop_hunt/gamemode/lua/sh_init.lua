// Help info
GM.Help = [[Prop Hunt is a twist on the classic backyard game Hide and Seek.

As a Prop you have ]]..HUNTER_BLINDLOCK_TIME..[[ seconds to replicate an existing prop on the map and then find a good hiding spot. Press [E] to replicate the prop you are looking at. Your health is scaled based on the size of the prop you replicate.

As a Hunter you will be blindfolded for the first ]]..HUNTER_BLINDLOCK_TIME..[[ seconds of the round while the Props hide. When your blindfold is taken off, you will need to find props controlled by players and kill them. Damaging non-player props will lower your health significantly. However, killing a Prop will increase your health by ]]..HUNTER_KILL_BONUS..[[ points.

Both teams can press [F3] to play a taunt sound.]]
